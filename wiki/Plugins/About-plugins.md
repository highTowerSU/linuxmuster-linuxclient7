Plugins can be used to expand the functionality of the linuxmuster-linuxclient7. The intention is to keep special use cases, like conky or static linking of folders like `Documents` and `Pictures`, out of the main codebase to keep it sleek.  
Plugins should be shipped as separate .deb packages. How exactly they will look is yet to be determined.
